Solve Brainbasher website puzzles

The website http://www.brainbashers.com/puzzles.asp contains a number of logic puzzles (e.g. sudoku).
This repository contains a number of programs solving some of these puzzles.

An important restriction is that brute force should be avoided as much as possible. 
In other words, solutions should be based on logic rules first.
